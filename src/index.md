I'm Luther. I recently completed a 16 week full-time game development course at The Developer Academy, while working on personal projects in my free time.

Bringing together 3 years of experience as a full-stack medical software developer and a Master's degree in Physics from Oxford University, I am equipped with a solid foundation to excel in collaborative settings, even under high-pressure conditions.

With a passion for technology and a keen eye for innovation, I am poised to pursue my lifelong passion and make significant contributions to the dynamic world of video games.
